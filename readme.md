## Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in backend/ with the following:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mern_csv_distributor
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
Start MongoDB (local):

bash
Copy code
# Linux/macOS
sudo service mongod start

# Windows (if installed via MongoDB service)
net start MongoDB
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Backend runs on: http://localhost:5000

Frontend Setup
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Start the frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000

Running the Application
Register users: Create an admin and some agent accounts via /api/auth/register (or seed the database).

Login as admin to upload files.

Upload CSV/XLSX files via the admin upload page.

Distributed lists will be saved in MongoDB. Admin can view all lists; agents can see their assigned lists (requires backend route /lists/me).

Usage Notes
File processing: Supports .csv, .xlsx, .xls. Unsupported files are skipped.

Distribution: Rows are split evenly among agents. If the number of rows isnâ€™t divisible, some agents may have one extra row.

Security: JWT tokens are required for all protected routes. Make sure tokens are stored in localStorage or a secure frontend state.

Frontend fetching: Make sure Axios attaches Authorization header:

js
Copy code
axios.get("/lists", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
Known limitation: Agents cannot fetch lists without a backend route specifically for them (/lists/me). Admin routes are restricted to admins only.

Scripts
Backend:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev      # Runs backend with nodemon
npm start        # Runs backend normally
Frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm start        # Runs frontend in development mode
npm run build    # Builds production-ready frontend
